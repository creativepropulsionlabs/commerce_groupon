order type which will be used as groupon order.

Flow.
1. Module periodically calls /get_orders and create local order.
2. For each imported line item (order item in terms of drupal commerce) /mark_exported would be  called
3. When an order is created on the drupal side manager should process the standard delivery process.
4. When manager updates info about tracking code in order shipping information (shipments entity on the drupal side)
module notifies Groupon about tracking code change  using /tracking_notification
5. If the order was purchased on Groupon side purchased order has been created and module fetches this info
from /purchase_orders endpoint by cron automatically for each order.
For each order endpoint /purchase_orders/acknowledgement automatically calls by cron.
